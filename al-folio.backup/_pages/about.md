I grew up in the capital of Brazil, Brasilia, where I went to college and got my degree in civil engineering from the University of Brasilia. When I was about halfway through it, I thought it would be a good idea to take a semester of classes abroad. That's when I boarded a plane to Porto, Portugal, and took a semester of classes at the University of Porto.   

After graduating, I moved to Hoboken, New Jersey, right across the Hudson River from New York City. There I got my masters degree in Engineering Management from Stevens Institute of Technology. My original plan was to apply that knowledge to better manage civil engineering projects. But there was one thing I could not have predicted: that I was going to fall in love for data science. Being able to automate tasks and to find "hidden messages" from otherwise unclear data felt like a superpower to me. My thesis project was an analysis of Twitter text data about the 2016 American elections, which led me to start a PhD in the same field, also at Stevens.  

In 2018 I had to leave my PhD and I returned to Brasilia. I went back to work with civil engineering, but after some time I realized that I was drifting away from my data science goals. Now I am happily dedicating all my efforts towards transitioning my career to data science. I am taking classes from the Applied Computation Masters Program from the Computer Science department at the University of Brasilia, as well as learning from various online sources and trying to engage in side projects whenever I have free time. I'm a lifelong learner, what can I say?!

Hi! My name is Danilo Brandao, I am an engineer and aspiring data scientist.  
I like to automate stuff and to optimize results by taking data-driven decisions, wherever and whenever possible. Finding information and extracting knowledge from what at first seems like meaningless data is something that piques my interest!

One of the beauties of Data Science is that it can be used to improve almost anything! From urban planning and mobility, to marketing research and opinion mining. I know it sounds a bit cheeky, but I still see it as a superpower of sorts. That is why I decided to pursue it!

I listed a few highlights of my professional career down below. 

 * 2007: Started Civil Engineering at University of Brasilia at the age of 17
 * 2011: Semester abroad at the University of Porto in Portugal (even got to attend a conference there!)
 * 2014: Got a full scholarship and moved to the US for grad school (just across the Hudson River from NYC)
 * 2015: Graduate internship at NYC Transit, where I got certified to walk the tracks of the NYC subway system ðŸš‡ (it still feels like all of that was a dream).
 * 2016: Got my master's degree in Engineering Management from Stevens Institute of Technology and started a PhD in the same field, also at Stevens ðŸŽ“.

 When I am not studying or working on something data-related, you will probably find me exercising my creative/artistic side. From watercolor paintings, relief printing and silkscreening to woodworking and leathercrafting, I enjoy doing them all!
