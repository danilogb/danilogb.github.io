<p>Hi there! My name is Danilo Brand√£o, and I am a data scientist and engineer based in Porto, Portugal.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is a buzzword these days, but I think I can say I fell in love with it back in 2005 when I was still in high school. Back then, I took a career orientation/vocational training type of thing in which I played with Lego Mindstorms - a really cool type of Lego with actual motors and a "brain" unit that you can program. I was hooked!</p>

<p>Fast-forward almost two decades, many explored paths and 3 engineering degrees later, and here I am. By September 2023, I hope to have finished my Masters in Data Science and Engineering and be fully transitioned into a career in the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science/Machine Learning field. Some of the sudomains that currently pique my interest are Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis.</p>

<p>I am always up for exercising and expressing my creativity, so when I am not in front of the computer crunching data, you will probably find me drawing, doing some block printing, making recycled paper, wooden furniture, customizing a mechanical keyboard, or crafting a leather wallet or bag. What can I say? I really like to make things from scratch with my hands &#128513;.</p>

<p>If it's sunny outside, that is enough excuse for me to hop on my mountain bike and ride a trail or even just bike around the city. Gotta take in that vitamin D, right?</p>
