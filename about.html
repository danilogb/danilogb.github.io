<!-- <p>Hi there! My name is Danilo Brandão, and I am a data scientist and engineer based in Porto, Portugal.</p>

<p>Artificial Intelligence is a buzzword these days, but I think I can say I fell in love with it back in 2005 when I was still in high school. Back then, I took a career orientation/vocational training type of thing in which I played with Lego Mindstorms - a really cool type of Lego with actual motors and a "brain" unit that you can program. I was hooked!</p>

<p>Fast-forward almost two decades, many explored paths and 3 engineering degrees later, and here I am. By September 2023, I hope to have finished my Masters in Data Science and Engineering and be fully transitioned into a career in the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science/Machine Learning field. Some of the sudomains that currently pique my interest are Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis.</p>

<p>I am always up for exercising and expressing my creativity, so when I am not in front of the computer crunching data, you will probably find me drawing, doing some block printing, making recycled paper, wooden furniture, customizing a mechanical keyboard, or crafting a leather wallet or bag. What can I say? I really like to make things from scratch with my hands &#128513;.</p>

<p>If it's sunny outside, that is enough excuse for me to hop on my mountain bike and ride a trail or even just bike around the city. Gotta take in that vitamin D, right?</p> -->

<p>Hello! Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Danilo Brandao, a dedicated data science and engineering professional fueled by a passion for uncovering insights and enabling data-driven solutions. I hold a Master's in Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology and I'm completing my Master's in Data Science and Engineering at the University of Porto's Faculty of Engineering (FEUP). I'm also a certified Associate Data Scientist through DataCamp.

<p>My educational path has taken me across three continents, earning a Bachelor's in Civil Engineering from the University of Brasília, a Master's in Engineering in the United States, and now wrapping up a data-focused Master's in Portugal. These diverse experiences have enriched my perspective and strengthened my analytical approach to tackling complex problems.</p>

<p>While currently a full-time student, I have professional experience as an engineer, intern, and teaching assistant. These roles have allowed me to apply my skills in impactful, real-world settings.</p>

<p>My aim is to leverage data to drive positive change, regardless of industry. I find fulfillment in uncovering insights, enabling operations through automation, and ultimately improving people's lives.</p>

<p>I take pride in my achievements, including earning a full scholarship for my U.S. Master's and ranking first for admission to my current Master's program. I firmly believe in continuous learning and the power of collaboration. My experiences abroad have instilled in me a global mindset that I aim to apply through an international career.</p>

<p>I thrive under pressure, consistently finding creative solutions to meet critical objectives. My motivation stems from positively impacting others, both directly through my work and by sharing knowledge. In the words of Einstein, "the measure of intelligence is the ability to change." I embrace change and continually adapt to grow both personally and professionally.</p>

<p>When I'm not at the computer crunching data, you'll probably find me out on the streets taking photographs or getting a workout in at the gym!</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to sharing more about my journey and insights in the world of data!</p>
